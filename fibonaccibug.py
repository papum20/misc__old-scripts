# COMPLEXITY: O(KlogK) where the overall K is the sum of all K in an input
# IDEA: Since the fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, there are only log(K) possible degrees.
# Thus after filtering multiple offers for the same degree, we have log(K) offers.
# Then you can efficiently solve a knapsackÂ problem for each day.
