# misc__old-scripts
a few scripts written in different languages some time ago;
some, probably most (or maybe all) of them are either useless or not working...
for sure these scripts are messy and badly written; I just keep them temporarily "for backup".

## algorithms/
basic well-known algorithms written not much time ago, but still probably not well written and I don't remember if they work.
## debug-c++/
files (written in python) to debug tasks solutions (written in c++)
## python/
python scripts
